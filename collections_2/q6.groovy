Map m=['1' : 2, '2' : 3, '3' : 4, '2':5]

println m // when we print the map, the  value of key [2] i.e 3 overwriiten by value 5
/* the key 2 is written with both 3 and 5
but it will take the last value attached with key,
it is not the valid construction coz the key for each value
should be different
